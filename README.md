# deliveryGirl
A flutter project to aid delivery workers in their work. This project serves to give delivery workers much needed information that the company withholds.Information such as delivery address and if the customer has tipped. I found this information out myself as I was working as a delivery girl here in Toronto and found myself in a position where I wanted to automate the process of getting shifts. Basically here in Toronto Foodora shifts were near impossible to get in the summer time and I really wanted shifts so it was natural to me to try and automate that frustration away! I have an iOS phone and thus could not really use a screen tapper, etc etc so I needed to sniff on the API and take the app apart a bit. I got the IPA file and looked at strings etc. Also started using a network inspection tool to sniff on the private API. I have an article about these facts on medium https://medium.com/@juliapak_633/hacking-solely-using-your-un-jailbroken-iphone-using-sirishortcuts-and-httpcatcher-no-laptop-c5e9d0f6848e?source=friends_link&sk=d56a7015778218085e581be58c03d2f1 This project will cover getting address information of the drop off as well as tipping information. I dont plan on putting shift grabbing functionality in until later.
